# *INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT MANGEMENTCHAPTER
## "Why IT projects fail"
- ­**changing objective during project**, because many project managers had the feeling that their IT project would never stop growing. First they change Scope creep, is refers to uncontrolled and unexpected changes in user expectations and requirements as a project progress, and feature creep is refers to uncontrolled addition of features to a system with a wrong assumption that one small feature will add nothing to cost or schedule.
-­ **Unrealistic time or resource estimate**’. Because estimation mistakes of time or resource cause project related problems, and one common problem during the creation of the work breakdown structure is assuming that the time on task equals duration. And another common problem is using linear approximation when estimating schedule.
­‐ **Lack executive support and user involvement**. Because some companies and academic institution has focused on the lack of executive support and user involvement as two main difficulties in managing IT projects.
­‐ **Inappropriate skills**. Most IT projects require a diverse range of skills. Many teams lack the breadth, and depth they require. It is also not easy for technology based organization to find the experienced people they need because sometimes few people in the labor market have the necessary skills.

## what makes project work different from normal day to day work of business? (project attributes)
- has a **unique** purpose
- **temporary**
- **budget**
- is developed using progressive elaboration
- requires resources, often from various areas

## Briefly explain how the triple constraint of Scope, Time and Cost can effect project completion.
­‐ Project scope management involves defining and managing all work required to complete project.
-­ Project time management includes estimating project duration developing schedules and ensuring timely completion of project,
- ­And project cost management of preparing and managing the project budget; includes resource planning, cost estimating, and cost budgeting

## the project management knowledge areas.
­‐ Scope management
-­ Time management
-­ Cost management
-­ Quality management
-­ Human resource management
-­ Communications management
-­ Risk management
-­ Procurement management
-­ Project integration management

## List and briefly explain what constitutes project success.
-­ The project met scope, time and cost goals
-­ The project satisfied the customer/sponsor
-­ The results of the project met its main objective, suchas making or saving a certain amount of money, providing a good return on investment, or simply making the sponsors happy.

## List 6 attributes that a successful Project manager should have.
-­ Leadership Skills
-­ Integrity, ethical behavior, consistent
-­ Strong at building trust, team
-­ Verbal communication
-­ Conflict resolution, conflict management
-­ Critical thinking, problem solving
## what is the job role for each job
-­ IT Project manager for a broad range of product including but not limited to Data centre implementation/Active directory implementation/SharePoint improvement/online development.

The various management roles and responsibilities involved in a project are fully described and are adaptable to suit the complexity of the project and skills of the organization. PRINCE2 provides a method for managing projects within a clearly defined framework.-­‐The (PMBOK) ‘Project Management Body of Knowledge’ describes the PMI’s view of the relevant topics and knowledge within the Project Managem

# *Organizational Structures
## functional organizational structure
> hierarchy
> **functional managers** or **vice presidents** in specialties, and their staffs have specialized skills in their respective disciplines

## project organizational structure
> everything is a project

## matrix organizational structure

## methodology/framework
### SDLC(waterfall model)
1. analysis
    - 对应 initiation
    - what is the problem
    - business case: document that outlines the benefits and costs of the project cost/benefit analysis
    - preliminary cost estimate:
2. design
    - 对应 development
    - new database
3. implementation
    - 对应 execution
4. maintenance
    - 对应 control

### agile
planning
execution

1. stakeholder register
    - who has an interest in the project
2. kick-off meetings
    - review the goals of the project, and discuss future plans
3. project planning
4. gantt chart
5. list of prioritized risks

### other methodology/frameworks:
- SDLC(waterfall model)
- six sigma
- PMBOK
- PRINCE 2
- agile

## *project life cycle
> a project life cycle is a collection of project phases that defines
> - what work will be performed in each phase
> - what deliverables will be produced and when
> - who is involved in each phase, and
> - how

a **deliverable** is a product or service produced or provided as part of a project

### *Phases (5 process)
1. initiation phase
  - project definition
  - project constraints
  - problem statement
  - define initial scope
  - estimate the cost
  -
2. planning phase
  - detailed planning
  - estimations & schedualing
  - what to do
  - how to do
  - how to know it is done
3. execution phase
  - code
4. control phase
  - report performance
5. project closure
  - ensure project acceptance
  - release resources
