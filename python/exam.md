## what is top-down design in software developmant?
- rather than solving the problem as a single unit (one large problem), break it into sub-problem and solbe sub-problems. When coding these sub-problems you can employ functions.

## variable
|                | Local Variable                                         | Glocal Variable                                   | Instance Variable - in a class                       |
|:---------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| __Definition__ | introduced inside a function                           | introduced outside of any functions in the proram | introduced in the constructor of a __class__         |
| __Scopt__      | the funstion it is defined in                          | the entire program                                | the entire class it is defined in                    |
| __Lifetime__   | until the function it is introduced in comes to an end | until the proram comes to an end                  | it can be used as long as the object can be accessed |

## OOP
### encapsulation
- encapsulation is the mechanism for restricting the access to some of an object components

### abstraction
-

### inheritance
- Methods defined in the superclass can be used in subclasses. Therefore, it is good because:
  - can re-use code
  - can reduce duplicate code
  - save time in programming due o reuseability of code
  - subclasses bcome more manageable

### polymorphism
- A method in a subclass may contain a different set of statements from the method in the superclass
- The method in the subclass is said to override the method in the superclass
