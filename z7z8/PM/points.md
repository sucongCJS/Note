- Project portfolio management address strategic goals of an organization, while project management address tactical goals.

- Several application development projects done for the same functional group might best be managed as part of a program.

- attribute of a project:
  - unique
  - using progressive elaboration
  - have a primary customer or sponsor


- Organizations have four different frames: structural, human resources, political, and symbolic.
  - structural frame: focuses on different groups roles and responsibilities to meet the goals and policies set by top management.
  - The human resources frame: focuses on producing harmony between the needs of the organization and the needs of people.
  - The political frame:  addresses organizational and personal politics.
  - The symbolic frame: focuses on symbols and meanings. (eg. expected work hours, employee dress codes, how the meetings are run)

- Personnel in a matrix organizational structure often report to two or more bosses.

- A deliverable is a product or service, such as a technical report, a training session, a piece of hardware, or a segment of software code, produced or provided as part of a project.

- Project life cycle: concept-> development-> implementation-> close-out

- outsourcing(offshoring) is when an organization acquires goods and/or sources from an outside source

- Project management processes:
  - Initiating includes actions to commit to begin or end projects and project phases. Some deliverables include  defining the business need for the project, getting a project sponsor, and selecting a project manager.
  - Planning includes creating workable plans for the entire project. Every knowledge area requires development  of some plans.
  - Executing involves coordinating everyone and everything to carry out the project plans. Deliverables include  the products of the project or phase.
  - Monitoring and controlling ensures the project objectives are met. Deliverables include monitoring and  measuring progress and taking corrective action.
  - Closing involves bringing the project to an orderly end. Deliverables include organizational process assets  updates and closed procurements.

- Pre-Initiation Tasks(done before it officially starts):
- Determine the scope, time, and cost constraints for the project
- Identify the project sponsor
- Select the project manager
- Develop a business case for a project
- Meet with the project manager to review the process and expectations for managing the project
- Determine if the project should be divided into two or more smaller projects

In the close-out phase, all of the work is completed, and there should be some sort of customer acceptance of the entire project. The project team should document its experiences on the project in a lessons-learned report.
  
- The impetus for a project is often to respond to a problem, an opportunity, or a directive.
  - Problems are undesirable situations that prevent an organization from achieving its goals. These problems can be current or anticipated. For example, users of an information system may be having trouble logging onto the system or getting information in a timely manner because the system has reached its capacity. In response, the company could initiate a project to enhance the current system by adding more access lines or upgrading the hardware with a faster processor, more memory, or more storage space.
  - Opportunities are chances to improve the organization. For example, the project described in the opening case involves creating a new product that can make or break the entire company.
  - Directives are new requirements imposed by management, government, or some external influence. For example, many projects involving medical technologies must meet rigorous government requirements.

- Configuration management ensures that the descriptions of the project's products are correct and complete.

- Project integration management includes the following processes:
  - Developing the project charter involves working with stakeholders to create the document that formally authorizes a project. Project charters can have different formats, but they should include basic project information and signatures of key stakeholders.
  - Developing the project management plan involves coordinating all planning efforts to create a consistent, coherent document the project management plan. The main purpose of project plans is to facilitate action.
  - Directing and managing project execution involves carrying out the project plans by performing the activities included in it. Project plan execution should require the majority of a project s budget.
  - Monitoring and controlling project work is needed to meet the performance objectives of the project. The project team should continuously monitor project performance to assess the overall health of the project.
  - Performing integrated change control involves identifying, evaluating, and managing changes throughout the project life cycle. A change control system often includes a change control board (CCB), configuration management, and a process for communicating changes.
  - Closing the project or phase involves finalizing all project activities. It is important to follow good procedures to ensure that all project activities are completed and that the project sponsor accepts delivery of the final products, services, or results of the project.

- The activity attributes provide more schedule-related information about each activity, such as predecessors, successors, logical relationships, leads and lags, resource requirements, constraints, imposed dates, and assumptions related to the activity.

- three basic reasons for creating dependencies among project activities:
  - Mandatory dependencies are inherent in the nature of the work being performed on a project. They are sometimes referred to as hard logic. For example, you cannot test code until after the code is written.
  - Discretionary dependencies are defined by the project team. For example, a project team might follow good practice and not start the detailed design of a new information system until the users sign off on all of the analysis work. Discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as soft logic and should be used with care since they may limit later scheduling options.
  - External dependencies involve relationships between project and non-project activities. The installation of a new operating system and other software may depend on delivery of new hardware from an external supplier. Even though the delivery of the new hardware may not be in the scope of the project, you should add an external dependency to it because late delivery will affect the project schedule

- Tracking Gantt chart a Gantt chart that compares planned and actual project schedule information.
The planned schedule dates for activities are called the baseline dates, and the entire approved planned schedule is called the schedule baseline.

- Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT):
PERT weighted average = (optimistic time  + 4*most likely time + pessimistic time)/6

??
- a forward pass through a project network diagram determine the early start and early finish dates for each activity

- cost is a resource sacrificed or foregone to achieve a specific objective or something given up in exchange.

- management reserves Dollars included in a cost estimate to allow for future situations that are unpredictable (sometimes called unknown unknowns)

- Commonly used tools and techniques include analogous cost estimating, bottom-up estimating, parametric modeling, the cost of quality, project management estimating software, vendor bid analysis, and reserve analysis.

- Variances are calculated by subtracting the actual cost or planned value from EV

- McClelland s Acquired-Needs Theory:
  - achievement
  - affiliation: People with a high need for affiliation (nAff) desire harmonious relationships with other people and need to feel accepted by others.

- Point of Total Assumption (PTA) = (Ceiling Price - Target Price)/Government Share + Target Cost
- Point of Total Assumption (PTA) — the cost at which the contractor assumes total responsibility for each additional dollar of contract cost in a fixed price incentive fee contract
