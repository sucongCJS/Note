# * INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT MANGEMENTCHAPTER
## "Why IT projects fail"
- ­changing objective during project
-­ Unrealistic time or resource estimate
­‐ Lack executive support and user involvement
­‐ Inappropriate skills

## what makes project work different from normal day to day work of business? (project attributes)
- has a **unique** purpose
- **temporary**
- **budget**
- is developed using progressive elaboration
- requires resources, often from various areas

## how the triple constraint of Scope, Time and Cost can effect project completion.
­‐ Project scope management involves defining and managing all work required to complete project.
-­ Project time management includes estimating project duration developing schedules and ensuring timely completion of project,
- ­And project cost management of preparing and managing the project budget; includes resource planning, cost estimating, and cost budgeting

## the project management knowledge areas.
-­ Project integration management 项目综合管理
­‐ Scope management 范围管理
-­ Time management 时间管理 gantt
-­ Cost management 成本管理
-­ Quality management 质量管理
-­ Human resource management 人力资源管理
-­ Communications management 沟通管理
-­ Risk management 风险管理
-­ Procurement management 采购管理

## 利益相关者
包括项目发起人, 客户, 开发团队等
甚至包括项目的反对者

## List and briefly explain what constitutes project success.
-­ The project met scope, time and cost goals
-­ The project satisfied the customer/sponsor
-­ The results of the project met its main objective, suchas making or saving a certain amount of money, providing a good return on investment, or simply making the sponsors happy.

## List 6 attributes that a successful Project manager should have.
-­ Leadership Skills
-­ Integrity, ethical behavior, consistent
-­ Strong at building trust, team
-­ Verbal communication
-­ Conflict resolution, conflict management
-­ Critical thinking, problem solving


# * Organizational Structures 组织
## functional organizational structure 职能型
> hierarchy
> **functional managers** or **vice presidents** in specialties, and their staffs have specialized skills in their respective disciplines

优点:
- 资源集中
- 专家可以为不同项目使用
缺点:
- 项目和部门利益冲突, 会更重视本部门的目标
- 没有产品经理, 只能靠职能经理之间的协调, 执行效率低
适用情况: 规模小, 以技术为重点

## project organizational structure 项目型
> everything is a project

优点:
-
缺点:
- 项目处于封闭状态
适用情况: 一个系统包含多个相似

## matrix organizational structure 矩阵型
> 垂直方向: 职能型, 水平方向: 项目型

缺点:
- 双重管理

## 框架
- 人力资源框架
- 政治框架
- 组织结构
-

## 很多组织关注于组织结构
屁股决定脑袋: 立场, 位置决定想法

## methodology/framework
### SDLC(waterfall model)
1. analysis
    - 对应 initiation
    - what is the problem
    - business case: document that outlines the benefits and costs of the project cost/benefit analysis
    - preliminary cost estimate:
2. design
    - 对应 development
    - new database
3. implementation
    - 对应 execution
4. maintenance
    - 对应 control

1. 软件定义阶段
    1.1. 问题定义
    1.2. 可行性分析
    1.3. 需求分析 与 建模
2. 软件开发阶段
    2.1. 设计
    2.2. 编码
3. 运行维护阶段
    3.1. 测试
    3.2. 维护

### agile
planning
execution

1. stakeholder register
    - who has an interest in the project
2. kick-off meetings
    - review the goals of the project, and discuss future plans
3. project planning
4. gantt chart
5. list of prioritized risks

### other methodology/frameworks:
- SDLC(waterfall model)
- six sigma
- PMBOK
- PRINCE 2
- agile

## * project life cycle
> a project life cycle is a collection of project phases that defines
> - what work will be performed in each phase
> - what deliverables will be produced and when
> - who is involved in each phase, and
> - how

a **deliverable** is a product or service produced or provided as part of a project

### * Phases (5 process)
1. initiation phase
  - project definition
  - project constraints
  - problem statement
  - define initial scope
  - estimate the cost
  -
2. planning phase
  - detailed planning
  - estimations & schedualing
  - what to do
  - how to do
  - how to know it is done
3. execution phase
  - code
4. control phase
  - report performance
5. project closure
  - ensure project acceptance
  - release resources



# terms
- outsource: have part of the work done by another company
- offshoring: outsource to other country
- virtual team: a group of individuals who work across time and space using communicaton techniligies
- SDLC(system development life cycle)

# fragement: kill point=phase exit

# * business case
- Introduction
- Proposal
- Justification
> why spend the money on this project

- preliminary project requirements
  - analysis of current system
  - define the problem
- current situation and problem
  - software out of datetime
  - high maintenance costs
- critical assumption and constraints
  - easy to install
  - compatible with current software and hardware
  - easy to use
  - not to costly
- analysis of options and recommendation
  -
- budget estimate and financial analysis
  - buy in software from outside vendor cost $...
  - program inhouse cost $...
- schedule estimate
  - purchase
- risk
> dont have to be specific
  - scope
  - time
  - cost
  - viruses

- Power

# Leadership
- visionary: see through the furture, bold
- coaching:
- affiliative
- democratic

# RAM
> Responsibility Assignment Matrix
![]()
department
a ~ maps the work of a project as descirbed in the WBS to the people responsible for performing the work

# RACI
> Responsibility, Accountability, Consultation, Informed
![](resource/)
responsibility: the people who do the jobs
accountability: the person check the work, the person that take blames. only one person that is accountable per task
a kid broke the neighboor's windows, the kid's father is accoutable, the kid is responsible
nooed
Consultation: consult before a decision
Informed: need to be Informed

# Resource Histogram

people like: managers, business analysts, programmers, technical writers

  - define goals
  - define Responsibilities

- storming
  - maintain focus
  - guide decision

- performing
  - one goal
  - work together

# * project stakeholder management process
1. **identifying** stakeholders
outputs: **Stakeholder Register**(table of stakeholder's name, job, email(assessment), position, internal/external...)
software: excel,

internal stakeholder: staff, sponsor
external stakeholder: customer, supplier

## challenges a stakeholder may present
- change the mind
- disagree with the project plan
- hard to contact
- does not understand the project

## ways to handle the challenges
- be clear from the start
- always have a plan B(contingency plan)
- explain the consequences
- take a stand

Power/Interest Grid
![](../resource/power_interest_grid.png)
interest: the responsibility of doing the job

2. **planning** stakeholder management
outputs:
3. **managing** stakeholder engagement3.
outputs:
4. **controlling** stakeholder engagement  3. 4.
outputs:

# critical path method & pert(CPM)
> the critical path method is the sequence of scheduled activities that determines the duration of the project
> program evaluation review technique(PERT)

must follow the sequence one after another
CPM descirbes the **longest** sequence of tasks in the project

**CPM diagram**
![](../resource/stakeholder_register.png)
the CPM is the path that takes longest
if we want to shorten the project, the task that on the critical path and takes more time will usually be shortened
:warning: tasks on the lines, numbers in the nodes
